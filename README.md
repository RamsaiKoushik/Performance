# Performance

Problem Tackled:
CPU,RAM and Storage are the most important resources required for any system to function smoothly. For an
ideal user experience, various applications and games need to utilize these resources very optimally. Existing Linux
tools(like top, free, desktop) help in identifying any misbehaving applications. But, they do it individually with
different commands which is cumbersome to correlate the output data of these three tools for identifying the exact
culprit.
Solution:
I have developed one standard tool which captures all these (CPU,Storage,RAM) diagnostic information in one go.
This tool will work across all the the Linux systems ranging from android watches, phones chromebooks, PC to server
workstations.
